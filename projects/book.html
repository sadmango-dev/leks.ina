        <p tyle="text-align:center">
            I had the lovely opportunity to co-author a mathematics book for 1st graders with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/babicheva/?locale=en_US">Tatiana Babicheva</a>. It introduced the basic
            concepts used in combinatorics problems - parity, knights and knaves, etc. Additionally, it included
            well-known strategy games - battleship, minesweeper, etc. <br><br>
            It was a really interesting experience, which gave me the opportunity to think about maths using a different
            lense. Rephrasing and breaking down concepts in a way understandable to an 8 y.o. once again made me appreciate
            the elegancy and simplicity of ideas, which are actually used on an almost every-day bases by mathematicians of
            all levels. <br><br>
            And of course, as problem-solving and mathematics are very dear to me and are at the core of most things I do,
            it was very heartwarming to think that through this book we might be helping someone in the beginning of
            their own journey.
