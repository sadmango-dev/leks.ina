            "Do more projects" - the advice that started this one. 
            <br><br>
            This my (almost-)first proper website. I feel quite proud of it despite its simplicity. Previously I have only made a small travel app using Django,
            but it was for my IB Internal Assesment, so it didn't feel quite as valueable as this one. 
            <br><br>
            This website only uses basic HTML and CSS. I was really invested into this project and learnt a lot. Out of principle, I decided not to use any AI help.
            When I encountered a problem, Stack was my main source of help. I was very passionate in the beginning about setting it up and running, so was devoting lots of time to it; 
            now I am gradually updating the website in my free time. This project also prompted me to learn how to use git, so that 
            I can update it straight from the laptop. If you have any suggestions
            or recommendations on how to make it better - feel free to reach out, I gladly appreciate critique.
