            "Do more projects" - the advice that started this one. 
            <br><br>
            This is my (almost-)first proper website. I feel quite proud of it despite its simplicity. Previously I have only made a small travel app using Django for my IB Internal Assesment. Because of the mandatory
            nature of the project it didn't feel quite as valueable as this one. 
            <br><br>
            This website only uses basic HTML and CSS. I was really invested in this project and learnt a lot. Also, I don't think I previously appreciated the creative opportunities website development presents. Out of principle, I decided not to use any AI for my code.
            When I encountered a problem, Stack was my main go-to. I was very passionate in the beginning about setting it up and running, so was devoting lots of time to it; 
            now I'm taking this a bit slower and gradually updating the website in my free time. This project also prompted me to learn how to use Github, so that 
            I can update it straight from the laptop. <br><br> If you have any suggestions
            or recommendations on how to make it better - feel free to reach out, I gladly appreciate critique.
